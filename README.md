## This is a bank of questions for those students preparing for a Data Structure and Algorithms interview

---

## How to use this resource..

1. Understand the problem - This may sound simple, but ensure you understand exactly what the question is asking, and don't hesitate to slack any of the coaches if you want clarification!

2. Find a brute force solution - Finding a brute force solution guarantees that you find a solution. When searching
   for a brute force solution, there are a couple of things you can try. If a question asks for
   the (for example) longest path, you can solve it by finding every possible solution and comparing them. If you’re unsure how to approach a problem, try solving it by hand first and then codifying your approach into an algorithm. Remember that your solution can be super inefficient. It doesn’t matter at this point!

3. Optimise the brute force solution - You have shown you can solve the problem... so you can breathe a bit... but now you need to demonstrate you can not only identify inefficiencies, but rectify them.

4. Test the solution - This doesn't necessarily mean writing actual tests for every single question in this question bank, but after you have completed step 3 and have an optimised solution.... lets check it does what it says. You can call you solution function mutiple times, passing in generic test cases, edge cases, and anything you can think of that shows you have covered all the bases.
