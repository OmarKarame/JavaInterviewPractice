# This is a real question asked in a GS interview 2/2/22

##### Q) Given an input string of "UDLR". You need to move the robot to the corresponding coordinates (Up, Down, Left, Right). Coordinates were stored in int[x,y].

>     public int[] move(String commands) {

>     }

#### 4 test cases:

- String "UUU"
- String "URDL"
- String "UUDRLLRD"
- String "Up Down Left 2xRight Down" (trick question but they basically want you to move the robot "UDLRD")
